### Moonpig Front-end developer code challenge ###

### Installation ###

I'm using npm to run build scripts

* Install packages first - npm install
* Run npm run build  - This will build everything required to run the application
* Run npm run test - This will run Unit Tests - n.b. I've only written two tests due to time constraints
* Run npm run start - Build the application on a http server
* Test the application on http://localhost:8080/ once the server is on

### Notes ###
Can use any query/book on search box, results will return right away

### Tools used ###

Browserify for JS bundling
Babelify for JS compilation
Ugify for JS  parsing & compression
SCSS for CSS precompiling
Karma, Mocha, chai, sinon for Test suite

### Improvements ###
- Integrate and automated task runner (webpack - gulp) to separate the build on tasks - anyway everything can be executed from package.json
